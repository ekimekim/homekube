network map:
	hosts will be on the home 192.168.42.0/24 as normal
	services: 192.168.43.0/24
	pods: 192.168.64.0/19
		with each node having a /24 within that
the tutorials i'm following are using this network map:
	hosts: 10.240.0.0/24
		with masters on 10.240.0.{10,11,12}
		and workers on 10.240.0.{20,21,22} (with pod ranges 10.200.{0,1,2}.0/24 respectively)
	pods: 10.200.0.0/16
	services: 10.32.0.0/24

File structure:
	ca/ - certificate management, CSRs, certs and keys
		nodes/ - certs for specific nodes
	generated-files - general generated yaml files, eg. configs
	files/ - general non-generated files, eg. configs
	kubeconfigs/ - kubeconfig files
		nodes/ - kubeconfigs for specific nodes
	manifests/ - api objects to deploy to the cluster
	secrets/ - files generated by scripts, generally random keys, etc.
	static-pods/ - Pod objects that are not deployed via apiserver but run as static kubelet pods

deferred for now: API server should be HA
	this requires a HA IP (eg. with keepalived)
	for now will just hard-code charm for critical components (etcd, api server)
