network map:
	hosts will be on the home 192.168.42.0/24 as normal
	services: 192.168.43.0/24
	pods: 192.168.64.0/19
		with each node having a /24 within that
the tutorials i'm following are using this network map:
	hosts: 10.240.0.0/24
		with masters on 10.240.0.{10,11,12}
		and workers on 10.240.0.{20,21,22} (with pod ranges 10.200.{0,1,2}.0/24 respectively)
	pods: 10.200.0.0/16
	services: 10.32.0.0/24

better way of doing node initialization:
	https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/
	lets you have a single long-lived bootstrap token which allows the bearer to create and get
		signed a client cert for themselves.

deferred for now: API server should be HA
	this requires a HA IP (eg. with keepalived)
	for now will just hard-code charm for critical components (etcd, api server)


New approach: install things in place.
	files/HOSTNAME/ contains things to install into the filesystem
